<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Probability!</h3>

<p>
 This week was filled with probability! With the movie recommendation project in the works re-affirming Bayesian Inference was a must, although some of <a href="/Bayes Inference, Expectation, Randomness">this notebook</a> (Bayes Inference...) was a bit of review, I'm not at a point where probability, especially conditioning on multiple events is super intuitive, but python definitely helps to gain more insight. Expectations are weighted averages, not a difficult topic, the linearity and total expectation properties lead to more difficult problems becoming simple; variance should always be calculated using expectations. Have been here before with random variables, the real meat of probability! Solving (note in notebooks) problems similar to hat problem, coupon collector, really only using discrete r.v.s and pmfs in this notebook.</p>
  <p>
    Getting into <a href="/Measures of Randomness">Measuring Randomness</a> I explore what will really contribute to the movie recommender. Using entropy to measure the information gained in each set of ratings, and divergence to compare the inherent values to the predicted values. In the notebook <a href="/Measures of Randomness">Measuring Randomness</a> I go through calculating entropy, divergence, mutual information, and play a bit geometric distributions. With all three of these measurements being rooted in machine learning (i.e.decision trees, information gain), it is great to gain some real practice with using entropy and divergence at a lower level than simply looking at scikit-learn docs! Information theory is a fascinating subject, and measuring randomness is really the foundation to the entire field. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I may upload so older data explorations, though some are pretty rough and all over the place. Movie recommender mini project is basically done will upload to github once finished. I've been looking into the <a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+QMSE01+Fall2016/about" style='color:#930000;'>Quantum Mechanics</a> course on Stanford Online, it has been great so far, highly recommended. Also Mining Massive Datasets is about to open up, I may venture into that. Next (new) post will include more probability, using undirected graphical models as data structures for probability distributions. Next project is robot localization!

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First Post</h3>

<p>Welcome! I will be using this blog to post data reports, explorations, and tutorials. 
Links along the right side and should render html, code available to be downloaded in github repo.
I will post summaries for new explorations with data sources, hoping to get at least a couple in each week, stay tuned. Any
questions or comments email me: slootryan at gmail dot com</p><br>
<p>The data sets already explored include a couple Spark notebooks, where using databricks I explored word counts in Shakespeare's work and log data using Apache Spark, it's crazy how fast using Spark is compared to trying to do this same project on my machine! Both were basically not possible. The R markdowns include a couple of psets from Udacity's Data Analysis course (L4, L5, L6), the other two were tangents while taking the course. Exploring the classic Diamonds dataset, focusing on a bunch of visualization. The Global food supply was an analysis of the global food prduction per person--the (most complete) newest data I could get was from 2007--saw some interesting trends in the DRC, US, and globally. I delved into some more advanced visualizations in the food supply analysis with Plotly.</p>
<p>I have a few more, that I may upload, that are not yet complete. New posts coming should be more interesting, and will include mathmatical sets (i.e. probabalistic) and more machine learning.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
